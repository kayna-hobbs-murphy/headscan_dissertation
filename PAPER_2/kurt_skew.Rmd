Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. This value can be positive or negative.

A negative skew indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution, which extends towards more negative values.
A positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right side of the distribution, which extends towards more positive values.
A value of zero indicates that there is no skewness in the distribution at all, meaning the distribution is perfectly symmetrical.
Kurtosis is a measure of whether or not a distribution is heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.

The rule of thumb seems to be: If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical. If the skewness is between -1 and â€“ 0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the data are moderately skewed. If the skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, the data are highly skewed.

The kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3.
If a given distribution has a kurtosis less than 3, it is said to be playkurtic, which means it tends to produce fewer and less extreme outliers than the normal distribution.
If a given distribution has a kurtosis greater than 3, it is said to be leptokurtic, which means it tends to produce more outliers than the normal distribution.
