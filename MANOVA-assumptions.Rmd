FOR EACH MEASURE: 

To check normality:
QQ plot (A Q-Q plot or Quantile-Quantile plot is a common graphical way to check data for non-normality. Quantile is another term for percentile. A Q-Q plot is a plot of the quantiles of a data set versus the quantiles of a reference theoretical distribution. This plot is used to assess normality of residuals. Curvature and outliers indicate problems. Note: The QQ plot is not useful until variance is
approximately equal.)

shapiro.test with p value greater than 0.05 (Histograms and QQ plots are usually more informative than the tests, because small sample sizes generally “pass” the test (high p-value, no evidence against normality), and large sample sizes generally “fail” (small p-value, evidence against normality).)

 
To check for outliers:

Standardized (or studentized) residuals are residuals that have been
“standardized” by dividing each residual by it’s SE.
• They have approximately a t-distribution, which is approximately
normal for moderate sample sizes, so we expect that about 95% of the
standardized residuals will be between -2 and +2. Values greater in
absolute value than 3.5 are usually considered outliers.
• In R, standardized residuals can be found using
rstandard(ModelObject).


To check homogeneity of covariances/equal variance:

Box's test (homegeneity of variance-covariance matrices)

Levene’s test of equality of variances (homogeneity of variances)

Plot of residuals vs fitted values (equal scatter; This is the primary diagnostic plot for assessing linearity and constant
variance. Curvature, unequal variance (megaphone) or outliers indicate problems.)



To check linear response:

Plot of resids vs fitted values (should not show a trend)

Look to pages 20-end 512 MultReg1



For y variables: You should have an adequate sample size. Although the larger your sample size, the better, at a bare minimum, there needs to be as many cases (e.g., particpants) in each cell of the design as there are number of dependent variables. 12 dependent variables


For MANOVA, the dependent variables should be somewhat correlated.

Power analysis to find sample size - 278
NAs shouldn't be over 20%
Find outliers & remove
Double check correlations
