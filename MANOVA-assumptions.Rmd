From Ann:

For MANOVA (= formal analysis), may want to think about how to use “other” or “no answer” categories.
Also consider whether you want to include all interactions.
If you do, consider the combination of the two issues above.   
 
When retaining “other” and “no answer” categories, there are a total of
3 genders (including 14 Other)
5 races (including 29 Other)
3 age groups
This yields a total of 3*5*3 = 45 possible combinations, but only observe 35 total combinations.  Some of those combinations include only 1-2 people.

ADDITIVE MODEL
 
Use summary() to get tests corresponding to predictors.
For MANOVA there are several possible methods for testing.   
 
Personally, I would not worry about doing Box’s test.  You might mention the corresponding assumption, but I am not inclined to do a formal test.   Or if you really do want to run it, perhaps do it separately by each factor (gender, race, age_group).
